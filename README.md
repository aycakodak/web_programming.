# Web Programming Assignment

## Theme
This website was created as an HTML5 assignment. The goal is to demonstrate the use of **HTML structural and semantic elements** by building a multi-page website. The site has a **personal portfolio / sample organization** theme.

## File Structure
- `index.html` → Home page
- `about.html` → About page
- `services.html` → Services page (contains a table)
- `contact.html` → Contact page (contains a form)
- `assets/` → Folder for images (`resim1.jpg` used)
- `README.md` → This file

## HTML Elements Used
- `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`  
- `<figure>`, `<figcaption>`, `<table>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<tfoot>`  
- `<form>`, `<fieldset>`, `<legend>`, `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<select>`, `<option>`, `<button>`  
- `<details>`, `<summary>`, `<blockquote>`  
- `<img>` for images

## Challenges
- Initially, setting up the GitHub remote caused issues.  
- Correct placement of HTML5 semantic elements required careful attention.
